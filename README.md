# lean-team-analytics
A suit of tools for lean-teams to analyse themselves and improve.

## Introduction
As team lead, scrum master and, more than anything else, a fan of agile-development I am a strong believer of self-organized teams. To facilitate this, teams need to have the tools to monitor themselves for them to improve. ``lean-team-analytics`` provides an lightweight proxy server that collects data from JIRA, transforms it with basic statistical processes, and exposes it as a set of REST API services.
